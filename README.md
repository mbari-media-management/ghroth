# ghroth

A simple UI application used to simulate Localization events exactly as Cthulhu creates and publishes them.

## Quick Start

```sh
mvn clean javafx:run
```

See also [oryx](https://github.com/mbari-media-management/oryx) which is a sister application that displays the localizations as they are created.
